# FACE-TILT-USING-OPENCV
Online face tilt detection using OpenCV involves capturing real-time video, detecting facial landmarks (e.g., with Dlib or MediaPipe), and calculating the tilt angle by measuring the slope between eye positions. It helps in gesture control, attention tracking, or user interaction systems.
